Thus, output\nwould only be captured for example 4.\n\nAdding 'representations' to the ``capture_repr`` tuple would direct\nSphinx-Gallery to capture a 'representation' of the last statement, only if\nit is an expression. In examples 2, 3 and 4, the last statement is an\nexpression. If the ``capture_repr`` configuration was *not* an empty tuple,\nSphinx-Gallery would attempt to capture a 'representation' of the last\nexpression for these examples. This would be performed according to the order\nthat the ' ' methods are given in the tuple, with\npreference given to earlier methods.\n\nIf no 'representation' in the ``capture_repr`` tuple is present for a last\nexpression, nothing would be captured. For example, if the the configuration\nwas set to ``'capture_repr': ('_repr_html_')`` nothing would be captured for\nexample 2 as ``b`` does not have a ``_repr_html_``.\n\n"
